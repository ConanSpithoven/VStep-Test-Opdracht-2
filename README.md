# VStep-Test-Opdracht-2
## Obstacle Avoidance
Create a simulation which shows three circle-shaped objects. All objects will have their own start
position and will move towards a target destination. At some point in the simulation they might meet
and they will have to move so that they will not collide.
The circle-shaped objects should represent humans and can be positioned in a 3D world. Keep this in
mind when choosing a maneuver.
The following input is expected for each object: <br>
- 3D position [X, Y, Z world coordinates];
- Radius;
- Speed;
- 3D position for the Target Destination [X, Y, Z world coordinates]; <br>
<p>
  Please note that your solution should be able to handle any number of objects. You may assume that
there is always one plane which contains all the positions.
The output should be an application in which each step of both obstacles is demonstrated. To support
visualization, you may select any framework/engine as long as it can be started on a Windows PC
without any special licenses. The simulation may end when both objects have reached their destination.
Try to get as far as possible within 8 hours. Add comments and todos where needed.
